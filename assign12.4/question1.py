# Exercise 12.4. Here’s another Car Talk Puzzler ( http: // www. cartalk. com/ content/
# puzzlers ):
# What is the longest English word, that remains a valid English word, as you remove its
# letters one at a time?
# Now, letters can be removed from either end, or the middle, but you can’t rearrange any
# of the letters. Every time you drop a letter, you wind up with another English word. If
# you do that, you’re eventually going to wind up with one letter and that too is going
# to be an English word—one that’s found in the dictionary. I want to know what’s the
# longest word and how many letters does it have?
# I’m going to give you a little modest example: Sprite. Ok? You start off with sprite,
# you take a letter off, one from the interior of the word, take the r away, and we’re left
# with the word spite, then we take the e off the end, we’re left with spit, we take the s off,
# we’re left with pit, it, and I.
# Write a program to find all words that can be reduced in this way, and then find the longest one.
# This exercise is a little more challenging than most, so here are some suggestions:
# 1. You might want to write a function that takes a word and computes a list of all the words that
# can be formed by removing one letter. These are the “children” of the word.
# 2. Recursively, a word is reducible if any of its children are reducible. As a base case, you can
# consider the empty string reducible.
# 3. The wordlist I provided, words.txt , doesn’t contain single letter words. So you might want
# to add “I”, “a”, and the empty string.
# 4. To improve the performance of your program, you might want to memoize the words that are
# known to be reducible.
